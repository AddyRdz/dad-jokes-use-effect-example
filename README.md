# Starter Code for React API / Fetch Review

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Resource: I-Can-Haz-Dad-Joke API

### [Dad Joke Documentation](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api)

We will be greating a basic example of a joke card component in react. 

## We will be using the following React Tools:

- React functional components
- props
- useState
- useEffect
- FetchAPI (including setting custom headers)

## Stretch
- passing functions through props
- CSS styling

## Overview

Your application should make a random dad joke appear when the app loads.

### Goals:
- It should also display a large button that, when clicked, fetches a random dad
joke from the dad jokes API and displays it to the user. 
- Make it look as close to the image provided below.

## Bonus Features

Build a queue that stores the 10 most recently retrieved dad jokes!
Additionally, add some buttons that let you scroll back and forth through the
queue.

You should have:

- One button to get a new joke (append to queue). If there are >10 jokes in the
  queue, drop the oldest one.
- One button to advance to the next joke.
- One button to move to the previous joke.
